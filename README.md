# Assist.js

Takes care of onboarding your users, keeping them informed about
transaction status and comprehensive usage analytics with minimal
setup. Supports `web3.js` versions 0.20 and 1.0.

_note: `web3.js` 1.0.0 beta versions 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 have bugs when interacting with MetaMask, we recommend you avoid these versions of `web3.js`_

## Getting Started

To integrate Assist.js into your dapp, you'll need to do 5 things:

1. Create a free account and get an API key from [account.blocknative.com](https://account.blocknative.com)
2. Install the widget
3. Initialize the library
4. Call `onboard`
5. Decorate your contracts

### Install the widget

#### npm

```bash
npm i bnc-assist
```

#### Yarn

```bash
yarn add bnc-assist
```

#### Script Tag

The library uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
The current version is 0.8.3.
There are minified and non-minified versions.
Put this script at the top of your `<head>`

```html
<script src="https://assist.blocknative.com/0-8-3/assist.js"></script>

<!-- OR... -->

<script src="https://assist.blocknative.com/0-8-3/assist.min.js"></script>
```

### Initialize the Library

Full documentation of the `config` object is below, but the minimum required `config`
is as follows:

```javascript
var bncAssistConfig = {
  dappId: apiKey,       // [String] The API key created on https://account.blocknative.com

  networkId: networkId  // [Integer] The network ID of the Ethereum network your dapp is deployed on.
                        //           See below for instructions on how to setup for local blockchains.
};

var assistInstance = assist.init(bncAssistConfig);
```

### Call `onboard`

At some point in your dapp's workflow, you'll want to ensure users are within an environment which
will allow them to make transactions, such as a browser with MetaMask, unlocked wallet, etc.
This is done by calling `onboard`. Some dapps might want to call `onboard` immediately upon any page
load. Others may wait until loading certain pages or until a certain button is clicked.
In any event, it is as simple as calling:

```javascript
assistInstance.onboard()
  .then(function(state) {
    // User has been successfully onboarded and is ready to transact
    // Will resolve with the current state of the user
    // This means we can be sure of the following user properties:
    //  - They are using a compatible browser
    //  - They have a web3-enabled wallet installed
    //  - The wallet is connected to the config-specified networkId
    //  - The wallet is unlocked and contains at least `minimumBalance` in wei
    //  - They have connected their wallet to the dapp, congruent with EIP1102
  })
  .catch(function(state) {
    // The user exited onboarding before completion
    // Will let you know what stage of onboarding the user was up to when they exited via the state object
  })
```

### Decorate Your Contracts

The first three steps in the getting started flow will get your users onboarded. This step adds
transaction support in order to help guide your users through a series of issues that can arise
when signing transactions.

Using our decorated contracts will also enable some anonymized transaction-level metrics to give
you insights into things including but not limited to:

- How many transactions fail because a user doesn't have enough Ether
- How many transactions are started but rejected by the user
- How many users come to your dapp without a web3 wallet

Decorating your contracts is simple:

```javascript
var myContract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address)
var myDecoratedContract = assistInstance.Contract(myContract)

// and then replace `myContract` with `myDecoratedContract`
// throughout your app
// ...

```

You can then use `myDecoratedContract` instead of `myContract`.

To speed things up, you can decorate the contract inline:

```javascript
var myContract = assistInstance.Contract(new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address))
```

### `promiEvent`

If using web3 versions 1.0 and you would like to listen for the events triggered on the `promiEvent` that is normally returned from a transaction call, Assist returns the `promiEvent`, but it is wrapped in an object to prevent it from resolving internally in Assist. To get access to the `promiEvent` object you can call your methods like this:

```javascript
const { promiEvent } = await decoratedContract.myMethod(param).send(txOptions)

promiEvent.on('receipt', () => {
  // ...
})
```

### Initializing `web3` and including it in the `config`

`web3` isn't a required parameter as you might not have access to a web3 provider to instantiate web3 with until after the user has been onboarded and has a wallet installed. We recommend instantiating `web3` at the top level of your dapp once the window object is available like this:

```javascript
let web3Instance

if (window.ethereum) {
  web3Instance = new Web3(window.ethereum)
}

if (window.web3) {
  web3Instance = new Web3(window.web3.currentProvider)
}
```

Pass this instance in to the config (even if it is undefined). If the user didn't have a wallet when first arriving to your dapp, they will go through onboarding which will refresh the page once they have a wallet. On the refresh, the above web3 instantiation code will now get initialized with the provider.

If you _don't_ include your instantiated web3 instance in the config, Assist will grab `web3` from the window object if it is available. However this can cause issues as `web3` isn't always added to the window object (ie on some mobile wallets) and the version of `web3` that is usually attached to the window object is `0.20`. So if you happen to be using `1.0` but didn't pass it in, then you're contracts won't be decorated correctly.

## API Reference

### Config

A JavaScript Object that is passed to the `init` function. Default values are in [square brackets] where they are set by Assist.js.

```javascript
var config = {
  networkId: Number, // The network id of the Ethereum network your dapp is working with (REQUIRED)
  dappId: String, // The API key supplied to you by Blocknative (REQUIRED)
  web3: Object, // The instantiated version of web3 that the dapp is using

  headlessMode: Boolean, // Turn off Assist UI, but still retain analytics collection [false]
  messages: {
    // See custom transaction messages section below for more details
    txRequest: Function, // Transaction request has been initiated and is awaiting user approval
    txSent: Function, // Transaction has been sent to the network
    txPending: Function, // Transaction is pending and has been detected in the mempool
    txSendFail: Function, // Transaction failed to be sent to the network
    txStall: Function, // Transaction was sent but not received in the mempool after 30 secs

    txConfirmReminder: Function, // A warning to the user that their current transaction is still awaiting approval
    txConfirmed: Function, // Transaction is confirmed
    txSpeedUp: Function // The user has re-submitted a transaction with a higher gas price
  },
  images: {
    welcome: {
      src: String, // Image URL for welcome onboard modal
      srcset: String // Image URL(s) for welcome onboard modal
    },
    complete: {
      src: String, // Image URL for complete onboard modal
      srcset: String // Image URL(s) for complete onboard modal
    }
  },
  style: {
    darkMode: Boolean, // Set Assist UI to dark mode
    notificationsPosition: Object || String, // Defines where in the viewport notifications will be positioned. See below: 'Notification Positioning'
    css: String // Custom css string to overide Assist default styles
  },
  truffleContract: Boolean, // Set to true if contract object has been instantiated with truffle-contract [false]
}
```

### Notification Positioning

The position that notifications appear in the viewport can be configured by defining `style.notificationsPosition` in your config when initializing assist.

`notificationsPosition` can be either a `String` which will set only the desktop position, or an `Object` containing params `desktop` and/or `mobile` which set the notification position on desktop and mobile respectively.

Options for setting `desktop` positions: `['topLeft', 'topRight', 'bottomLeft', 'bottomRight']`

Options for setting `mobile` positions: `['top', 'bottom']`

By default, `Assist` positions notifications at the `top` of the viewport on mobile, and the `bottomRight` of the viewport on desktop.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Set notifications to bottom on mobile and top right on desktop
const config = {
  style: {
    notificationsPosition: {
      desktop: 'topLeft',
      mobile: 'bottom'
    }
  }
}
```

```javascript
// Sets only the desktop position
const config = {
  style: {
    notificationsPosition: 'bottomRight'
  }
}
```


### Custom Transaction Messages

Custom transaction messages can be set to override the default messages `Assist` provides. To do this you provide callback functions for each `eventCode` that you want to override. The callback functions must return a `String` and will be called with the following object to provide context information about the transaction:

```javascript
{
  transaction: {
    to: String, // The address the transaction is going to
    gas: String, // Gas (wei)
    gasPrice: String, // Gas price (wei)
    hash: String, // The transaction hash
    nonce: Number, // The transaction nonce
    value: String // The value of the transaction (wei)
  },
  contract: {
    // This object will be undefined if it is not a contract transaction
    methodName: String, // The name of the method that was called
    parameters: Array // The parameters that the method was called with
  }
}
```

You can provide a `messages` object to the `config` to set global message overrides. Each callback can parse the context object that is passed to it and decide what to return or just return a standard message for each `eventCode`:

```javascript
var config = {
  //...
  messages: {
    txSent: function(data) {
      return 'Your transaction has been sent to the network'
    },
    txConfirmed: function(data) {
      if (data.contract.methodName === 'contribute') {
        return 'Congratulations! You are now a contributor to the campaign'
      }
    }
    // ....
  }
}
```

Sometimes you want more granular control over the transaction messages and you have all the relevant information you need to create a custom transaction message at the time of calling the method. In that case you can also add custom transactions messages inline with your transaction calls which take precedent over the messages set globally in the config.

#### Example

```javascript
// 0.2 style send
myContract.vote(param1, param2, options, callback, {messages: {txPending: () => `Voting for ${param1} in progress`}})

// 1.0 style send
myContract.vote(param1, param2).send(options, {messages: {txPending: () => `Voting for ${param1} in progress`}})

// Transaction
Transaction(txObject, callback, {messages: {txPending: () => 'Sending ETH...'}})
```

The `messages` object _must_ always be the _last_ argument provided to the send method for it to be recognized.

### Ethereum Network Ids

The available ids for the `networkId` property of the config object:

- `1`: mainnet
- `3`: ropsten testnet
- `4`: rinkeby testnet

*The kovan testnet is not supported.*

#### Local Networks

When you are running locally (e.g. using ganache), set `networkId` in the config to the network id that the local network is set to. Any number that is not `1`, `3`, `4` and `42` is valid and will be recognized as a local network. If using the Ganache CLI you can set the network id via the `--networkId` option.

### State

`Assist` keeps track of the current state of the user environment as a JavaScript Object

```javascript
state = {
  mobileDevice: Boolean, // User is on a mobile device
  validBrowser: Boolean, // User is on a valid web3 browser
  currentProvider: String, // Current provider being used to connect to the network
  web3Wallet: Boolean, // User has a web3Wallet installed
  accessToAccounts: Boolean, // Dapp has access to accounts
  walletLoggedIn: Boolean, // User is logged in to wallet
  walletEnabled: Boolean, // User has enabled EIP 1102 compliant wallet
  accountAddress: String, // Address of the user's selected account
  accountBalance: String, // User account balance
  minimumBalance: String, // User has the minimum balance specified in the config
  userCurrentNetworkId: Number, // Network id of the network the user is currently on
  correctNetwork: Boolean, // User is on the network specified in the config
}
```

The promises that are returned from calls to `getState` and  `onboard` resolve and reject with this `state` object.

### Errors

All errors are called with `eventCode` and `message` properties.

#### Example

```javascript
{
  eventCode: 'initFail',
  message: 'An API key is required to run Assist'
}
```

#### Error Codes

The following are the possible error codes from Assist.js.

```
initFail          - initialization of the library failed
mobileBlocked     - mobile browsers are blocked from accessing this dapp
browserFail       - browser is not compatible with web3.js wallets
walletFail        - user does not have a web3-enabled wallet installed
walletEnableFail  - user has not logged into their wallet
networkFail       - user's web3 wallet is not connected to the correct network
nsfFail           - user does not have enough funds in their wallet
```

### Headless Mode

By default, Assist will create UI elements in your application at certain times to guide users. You can disable this feature and run Assist in "headless mode" by setting `headlessMode: true` in the config. This still enables you to collect analytics, but won't change the underlying behaviour of your application at all.

### Mobile Dapps

If your dapp _doesn't_ support mobile browsers, setting `mobileBlocked: true` in the config will detect mobile user agents and show UI that will direct them to use a desktop browser instead.

Assist supports mobile onboarding and transaction support. The onboarding UI has a modal for making sure that the user:

- Is on a mobile dapp browser/wallet
- Is on the correct network
- Has enabled connection to their wallet (if the wallet is using a modern ethereum provider)
- Has the minimum balance (if set in the config)

### Minimum Balance

By supplying an amount of wei to the `minimumBalance` option of the config, developers can limit access to their dapp to users who have at least this much Ether in their wallet.

### Repeat Transactions

Assist will detect transactions which look to be repeated. We notify users of repeat transactions when we see sequential transactions with the same `to` address and the same `value`.
