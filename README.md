## Getting Started

To integrate `assist.js` into your dapp, you'll need to do 4 things:

1. Create a free account and get an API key from [blocknative.com](https://blocknative.com)
2. Install the widget
3. Initialize the library
4. Call `onboard`
5. Decorate your contracts

### Install the widget

#### Script Tag
The library uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
The current version 0.3.0.
There are minified and non-minified versions.
Put this script at the top of your `<head>`

```html
<script src="https://assist.blocknative.com/0-3-0/assist.js"></script>

<!-- OR... -->

<script src="https://assist.blocknative.com/0-3-0/assist.min.js"></script>
```

#### npm

```
npm i bnc-assist
```

### Initialize the Library

Full documentation of the `config` object is below, but the minimum required `config`
is as follows:

```javascript
var bncAssistConfig = {
  dappId: dappId,       // [String] The API key supplied to you by Blocknative when you sign up for an account
  networkId: networkId  // [Integer] The network ID of the Ethereum network your dapp is deployd on.
                        //           See below for instructions on how to setup for local blockchains.
};

var assistInstance = assist.init(bncAssistConfig);
```

### Call `onboard`

At some point in your dapp's workflow, you'll want to ensure users have the proper environment.
This is done by calling `onboard`. Some dapps will call `onboard` immediately upon any page
load. Others may wait until loading certain pages or until a certain button is clicked.
In any event, it is as simple as calling:

```javascript
assistInstance.onboard()
  .then(function(success) {
    // User has been successfully onboarded and is ready to transact
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    // The user exited onboarding before completion
    // Will let you know what stage of onboarding the user was up to when they exited
    console.log(error.msg);
  })
```

### Decorate Your Contracts

The first three steps in the getting started flow will get your users onboarded. This step adds
transaction support in order to help guide your users through a series of issues that can arise
when signing transactions.

Using our decorated contracts will also enable some transaction-level metrics tracking to give
you insights into things like:

- How many transactions fail because a user doesn't have enough Ether
- How many transactions are started but rejected by the user

Decorating your contracts is simple:

```javascript
var myContract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address);
var myDecoratedContract = assistInstance.Contract(myContract)

// and then replace `myContract` with `myDecoratedContract`
// throughout your app
// ...

```

You can then use `myDecoratedContract` instead of `myContract`.

To speed things up, you can replace the contract after saving the original:

```javascript
var myContract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address);
var originalMyContract = myContract;
myContract = assistInstance.Contract(myContract)
```

## API Reference

### Config

A JavaScript Object that is passed to the `init` function. Default values are in [square brackets] where they are set by assist.js.

```javascript
var config = {
  networkId: Number, // The network id of the Ethereum network your Dapp is working with (REQUIRED)
  dappId: String, // The API key supplied to you by Blocknative (REQUIRED)
  web3: Object, // The instantiated version of web3 that the Dapp is using
  mobileBlocked: Boolean, // Defines if the Dapp works on mobile [false]
  minimumBalance: String, // Defines the minimum balance in Wei that a user needs to have to use the Dapp [0]
  headlessMode: Boolean, // Turn off Assist UI, but still retain analytics collection [false]
  messages: {
    // See custom transaction messages section below for more details
    txPending: Function, // Transaction is pending and awaiting confirmation
    txSent: Function, // Transaction has been sent to the network
    txSendFail: Function, // Transaction failed to be sent to the network
    txStall: Function, // Transaction was sent but not received in the mempool after 30 secs
    txFailed: Function, // Transaction failed
    nsfFail: Function, // User doesn't have enough funds to complete transaction
    txRepeat: Function, // Warning to user that they might be repeating a transaction
    txAwaitingApproval: Function, // Warning to user that they have a previous transaction awaiting approval
    txConfirmReminder: Function, // A warning to the user that their transaction is still awaiting approval
    txConfirmed: Function // Transaction is confirmed
  },
  images: {
    welcome: {
      src: String, // Image URL for welcome onboard modal
      srcset: String // Image URL(s) for welcome onboard modal
    },
    complete: {
      src: String, // Image URL for complete onboard modal
      srcset: String // Image URL(s) for complete onboard modal
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Transaction Messages

The functions provided to the `messages` object in the config, will be
called with the following object so that a custom message string can be returned:

```javascript
{
  transaction: {
    to: String, // The address the transaction was going to
    gas: String, // Gas (wei)
    gasPrice: String, // Gas price (wei)
    hash: String, // The transaction hash
    nonce: Number, // The transaction nonce
    value: String // The value of the transaction (wei)
  },
  contract: {
    // This object will be undefined if it is not a contract transaction
    methodName: String, // The name of the method that was called
    parameters: Array // The parameters that the method was called with
  }
}
```

#### Example

```javascript
var config = {
  //...
  messages: {
    txConfirmed: function(data) {
      if (data.contract.methodName === 'contribute') {
        return 'Congratulations! You are now a contributor to the campaign'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Ethereum Network Ids

The available ids for the `networkId` property of the config object:

- `1`: mainnet
- `3`: ropsten testnet
- `4`: rinkeby testnet

*The kovan testnet is not supported.*

#### Local Networks

When you are running locally (e.g. using ganache), set `networkId` in the config to the network id that the local network is set to. Any number that is not `1`, `3`, `4` and `42` is valid and will be recognized as a local network. If using the Ganache CLI you can set the network id via the `--networkId` option.

### Errors

All errors are called with `eventCode` and `message` properties

#### Example

```javascript
{
  eventCode: 'initFail',
  message: 'An API key is required to run assist'
}
```

### Headless Mode

By default, assist will create UI elements in your application at certain times to guide users. You can disable this feature and run assist in "headless mode" by setting `headlessMode: true` in the config. This still enables you to collect analytics, but won't change the underlying behaviour of your application at all.

### Mobile Dapps

By default assist's UI elements are responsive and support mobile displays, however some dapps don't work effectively in mobile viewports or with mobile web3 providers like Status.im or Coinbase Wallet. setting `mobileBlocked: true` in the config will detect mobile user agents and direct them to use a desktop browser instead.

### Minimum Balance

By supplying an amount of wei to the `minimumBalance` option of the config, developers can limit access to their dapp to users who have at least this much ETH in their wallet.

### Repeat Transactions

Assist will detect transactions which look to be repeated. We notify users of repeat transactions when we see sequential transactions with the same `to` address and the same `value`.

  })
```

### `Contract(contractInstance)`

#### Parameters

`contractInstance` - `Object`: Instantiated web3 `contract` object (**Required**)

#### Returns

A decorated `contract` to be used instead of the original instance
